    Augustus Horch organized a car manufacturing company. In 1910, the first Audi-A car was launched. In 1965, the
    Volkswagen group bought a controlling stake in Audi. One of the large-scale developments of the company's
    specialists was the company four-wheel drive, which in 1982 equipped the Audi 80 quattro. The 90s for the company
