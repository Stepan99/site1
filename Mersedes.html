<div class="about"><h2>About Mersedes</h2></div>
<div class="text">The history of the creation of the Mercedes-Benz brand is associated with two brands: the Mercedes
    brand, which was produced by the German company Daimler-Motor-Gesellschaft and the Benz brand. Both companies were
    quite successful and developed in parallel on their own in the German market. But in 1926 it was decided to merge
    the two companies into a single concern Daimler-Benz. The main office of the concern is located in Stuttgart. As a
    result of the merger in 1963, the legendary model 600 (the famous 600th Mercedes) rolled off the assembly line. It
    was a kind of challenge for Rolls-Royce company class cars. To date, the Mercedes S600 is equipped with an
    incredibly reliable and powerful powertrain, and its maneuverability is amazing for the large dimensions that this
    car has. Today, the company can boast probably one of the largest model series in the international car market. It
    includes sedans, compact hatchbacks, station wagons, convertibles, coupes, and roadsters, crossovers, minivans, and
    even brutal SUVs.
